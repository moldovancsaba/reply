# Reply — Roadmap

**Source of truth is the [MVP Factory Board](https://github.com/users/moldovancsaba/projects/1).** This file is reference only. Vision and priorities are tracked on the board (Product = reply; Roadmap = Status).

## Vision (reference)

- **Local reply app:** SwiftUI app that can generate or suggest replies to messages (keyword-based today; expandable).
- **Knowledge injection:** Ingest from Gmail, Google Drive, iCloud, Apple Notes, calendar events, and other local/online sources to annotate "how I act" so Reply can mirror the user's style and context. See [POC_FIRST_FUNCTIONS.md](POC_FIRST_FUNCTIONS.md).
- **Localhost chat POC:** Simple browser chat on localhost to ask for reply suggestions before any messaging integration. See [POC_FIRST_FUNCTIONS.md](POC_FIRST_FUNCTIONS.md).
- **Optional board integration:** Use GitHub Project V2 API (exploration already in repo) to read or update board cards from the app.
- **Optional messaging integration:** Future connection to WhatsApp, Mail, iMessage, or other channels for automatic or assisted replies.
