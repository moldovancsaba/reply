# Reply — Roadmap

**Source of truth is the [MVP Factory Board](https://github.com/users/moldovancsaba/projects/1).** This file is reference only. Vision and priorities are tracked on the board (Product = reply; Roadmap = Status).

---

## Vision (reference)

- **Local reply app:** SwiftUI app that can generate or suggest replies to messages (keyword-based today; expandable).
- **Optional board integration:** Use GitHub Project V2 API (exploration already in repo: GraphQL queries/mutations) to read or update board cards from the app.
- **Optional messaging integration:** Future connection to WhatsApp, Mail, iMessage, or other channels for automatic or assisted replies.
