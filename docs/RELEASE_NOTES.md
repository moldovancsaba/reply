- **SwiftUI Reply Machine:** Simple app with keyword-based reply generation (ReplyEngine + ContentView).
- **GraphQL exploration:** JSON files for GitHub Project V2 API (project id, fields, add item, set agent/product/fields) in repo root; not yet wired into the app.
- **Product onboarding:** Reply added as a product on the MVP Factory Board; agent operating document and repo docs (ROADMAP, TASKLIST, RELEASE_NOTES, brain dump) added; README expanded; issues #153 and #154 set to Product = reply.
