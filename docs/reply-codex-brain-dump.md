# Reply — Codex brain dump

Current job, where we left off, and open decisions. Update this at the end of each session.

---

## Current status

- **App:** SwiftUI "Reply Machine" with `ReplyEngine` (keyword rules) and `ContentView` (input + Generate Reply button). Runs on macOS.
- **Exploration:** GraphQL JSON files in repo root target GitHub Project V2 (project 1): `project_id_query.json`, `fields_query.json`, `text_fields_query.json`, `add_item_mutation.json`, `set_agent.json`, `set_product.json`, `set_fields.json`, `update_agent_field.json`. Not yet integrated into the app.
- **Docs:** ROADMAP, TASKLIST, RELEASE_NOTES, and this brain dump exist. Board is source of truth for next work.

## Where we left off

- Reply is onboarded to the MVP Factory Board (agent doc in mvp-factory-control, Product = reply on relevant issues). Next actionable work comes from the board (Product = reply, Status = Ready).

## Next

- Pick next task from the [MVP Factory Board](https://github.com/users/moldovancsaba/projects/1) (Product = reply, Status = Ready). Candidates include: further app features (#154), board API integration, or messaging connectors.
